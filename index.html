    <br>
    <div class="question">How do I use it?</div>
    <div class="answer">You simply talk to the app and use your phone's camera to show it the things you want to keep track of.</div>
     
    <div class="question">Is it only iOS?</div>
    <div class="answer">Early access is only for the iOS app. You can register below for other platforms.</div>

    <div class="question">Is it free?</div>
    <div class="answer">Not yet.</div>
 
    <div class="question">What is the tech behind?</div>
    <div class="answer">It uses language models and computer vision to understand the camera input and communicate with you in natural language.</div>

    <div class="question">Does it work offline?</div>
    <div class="answer">It is meant to be an offline app. One of the models is not yet quantized to run on metal so it uses cloud compute for that bit.</div>
